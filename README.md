### how to work this website


## This is a complete full stack project .you can easily order your favourite car and get it . complete this website by using Node,material ui, react ,css,html,js,firebase.it is a car collection website..

## i used firebase for the login system and also solved redirects and reload issue.

## When anyone click the buy button then he goes to login when he is a new user then he registers the website otherwise he could not buy a car because the order page is highly protected on private routes.

## This website has an admin panel and only admin can see this page. the system has also all product menu bar , review system , my order and many others feature are there
